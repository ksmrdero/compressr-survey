# CompresSR Compression Survey
A web application for users to compare CompresSR with other image compression algorithms. Hosted by Azure App Services using a Flask backend. Images are stored in Azure Blob Storage, and user input is saved in a SQL database. 

The offical implementation of CompresSR can be found [here](https://github.com/nhchen9/CompresSR).
